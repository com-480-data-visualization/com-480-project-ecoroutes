    <h1> Eco-Networks </h1>
    The following visualization reveals how cities, countries, and regions are linked not just by road routes, but by
    their environmental impacts as well.<br><br>

    Each colored line draws connections between destinations, with the color showing the average CO2 emissions. It’s a
    vivid exploration of how travel choices differ across Europe.<br><br>

    Understand the bigger picture, and let this visualization offer you a fresh perspective on the broader implications
    of travel. <br><br>

    Do you notice Switzerland? It is the leading country in Europe with 100 percent electric-powered trains,
    significantly reducing its overall CO2 footprint. Can you spot this trend on the graph? <br><br>

    <!-- <div>
        Start by clicking on the interactive map to select countries and dynamically add nodes to the graph that show
        you the network of travel connections. As you hover over any node, watch the connecting lines change their color
        based on average CO2 emissions. You can also switch perspectives easily — choose from city, country, or regional
        views to explore how travel patterns and environmental impacts differ at each level. The CO2 emissions at the
        country and region level are the average CO2 emissions between all routes connecting the two countries or
        regions.
