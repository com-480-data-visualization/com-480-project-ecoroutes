## Milestone 1 (29th March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

### Dataset

For our project, we've constructed our own dataset by extracting data from the  EcoPassenger [website](https://ecopassenger.hafas.de/bin/query.exe/en?L=vs_uic), which provides calculations for emissions and travel times across different modes of transport between cities. 

We selected a diverse set of 90 cities across Europe, guided by a principle to include at least one city from each country, alongside with others noted for their size and popularity. The city list was derived from the [Lists of cities in Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_cities_in_Europe). For each possible city pair, we extracted the travel times and environmental impacts (the carbon dioxide emissions and energy consumption)  across different modes of transportation (cars, trains, and planes). Moreover, we detailed the 'products' of each travel connection, which denotes the required changes in flights or trains necessary to complete each journey.

Furthermore, we enriched our dataset with geographical information, more specifically each connection's departure and arrival country, which will be used to do country-level analyses. We further augmented this data by categorizing each connection based on the departure and arrival regions, as defined by the [divisions of Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Europe), in order to explore regional travel patterns and their environmental implications.

Finally, for every city pair, we extracted its KML file, which will serve as a foundation for mapping the routes and will enhance our project by providing a visual representation of the travel networks across Europe.

### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work


> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
